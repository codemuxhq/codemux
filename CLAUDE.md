# codemux

Personal TUI multiplexer for coding-agent sessions. Single-user, Rust, ratatui + portable-pty + tui-term. See `docs/001--vision.md` for the full pitch and `docs/005--roadmap.md` for what's next per lane.

## Workflow conventions

- **No worktrees, no feature branches.** Personal repo — commit directly to `main`.
- **No AI trailers** in commit messages (no `Co-Authored-By: Claude`, no "Generated with").
- **Commit style**: `type(scope): subject`. Types: `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`. Scope is the phase tag (e.g. `p1`); omit for cross-cutting `chore`/`docs`.
- Lints are strict: `unwrap_used` and `expect_used` are deny; `clippy::pedantic` is warn. Use `#[allow(...)]` on the genuinely-OK cases.

## Just commands

`just --list` shows them all. **There is no CI** — `just check` (fmt --check + lint + test) is the only gate. Run it before every commit.

For verbose tracing: `RUST_LOG=codemux=debug just run` (the `EnvFilter` is scoped to the `codemux` target).

## Repo layout

Cargo workspace, edition 2024, resolver 3. Two binaries and four libraries:

- `apps/tui` — binary `codemux`. Owns local PTYs, runs the event loop, renders chrome.
- `apps/daemon` — binary `codemuxd`. Per-host daemon (AD-3) that owns remote PTYs and mirrors the child's screen with `vt100` for replay-on-attach. Exposes its supervisor as a `lib.rs` so integration tests can drive it in-process without forking.
- `crates/session` — agent lifecycle bounded context. Application core; has a `test-util` feature.
- `crates/shared-kernel` — IDs only (`HostId`, `AgentId`, `GroupId`); zero vendor deps.
- `crates/wire` — protocol message types between `codemux` and `codemuxd`. Pure data, depends only on `thiserror`.
- `crates/codemuxd-bootstrap` — SSH adapter. A `build.rs` assembles a daemon tarball; the crate ships it to remote hosts on first connect. Consumed by `apps/tui`.

Dependency edges:

- `apps/tui → session, shared-kernel, codemuxd-bootstrap, ratatui/tui-term/crossterm`
- `apps/daemon → wire, portable-pty, vt100` — the `vt100` edge is **the one deliberate carve-out** to "no TUI deps outside `apps/tui`": the daemon needs a pure parser to mirror remote screens for replay-on-attach.
- `codemuxd-bootstrap → session`
- `session → shared-kernel`
- `wire → nothing`

**Never** any TUI-rendering dep (ratatui, tui-term, crossterm) outside `apps/tui`. Architecture rationale lives in `docs/004--architecture.md` (AD-1 through AD-29).

## Where things live

| Need to change | Look at |
|---|---|
| A new key binding or remap | `apps/tui/src/keymap.rs` (action enum + Bindings POD) — the help screen and config loader pick it up automatically |
| Spawn-modal behavior (host/path zones, autocomplete) | `apps/tui/src/spawn.rs` (single concrete struct — read the top-of-file comment before adding a second variant) |
| Top-level event routing, prefix-key state machine | `apps/tui/src/runtime.rs` `dispatch_key` |
| What renders on screen | `apps/tui/src/runtime.rs` `render_frame` and its helpers |
| CLI flags and env vars | `apps/tui/src/main.rs` `Cli` struct |
| Config file format | `apps/tui/src/config.rs` + the `Bindings` types in `keymap.rs` |
| Agent / Host / status domain types | `crates/session/src/domain.rs` |
| Daemon supervisor, remote PTY ownership | `apps/daemon/src/lib.rs` (binary entry in `main.rs` is a thin shell) |
| Wire protocol message types | `crates/wire/src/` |
| SSH bootstrap / daemon tarball assembly | `crates/codemuxd-bootstrap/` (`build.rs` rebuilds the embedded tarball when `apps/daemon`, `crates/wire`, or `Cargo.lock` change) |
| E2E test strategy and roadmap | `docs/testing.md` (TUI tests live in `apps/tui/tests/`, daemon tests in `apps/daemon/tests/`) |

## Key invariants worth knowing

- **AD-1: codemux never semantically parses Claude Code.** PTY → vt100 → tui-term → ratatui pane. We render Claude's output, we don't interpret it. Don't be tempted to tail `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl`.
- **The keymap is the single source of truth.** Bindings POD drives behavior, the help screen, and the status-bar hints. Add a new action by extending the enum + Bindings struct + lookup table; everything else follows.
- **Per-component error types via thiserror, `#[non_exhaustive]`.** No shared workspace-wide `Error` enum. The binary uses `color-eyre` at the edge.
- **Failure mode for config**: missing file = defaults; present-but-invalid = exit non-zero with readable error before touching the terminal. Never silent fallback.
- **Kitty Keyboard Protocol auto-enables** when any binding uses `SUPER` (Cmd/Win). User writes `prefix = "cmd+b"`, the protocol negotiation follows. The help screen is the user-visible escape hatch when their terminal can't deliver Cmd.
